# WikiBib - Literature Manager and dashboard

This repo is a propotype for bibliography management using Wikidata. 

The overarching goal is to leverage linked open data to navigate your studies and personal notes. 
It is aimed at facilitaing the daily habit of reading research articles. It was built with 3 core features in mind:

- List of articles in plain text
- Version control of notes
- Semantic record of readings

You can check an example of a query dashboard for readings at [lubianat.github.io/wikidata_bib](https://lubianat.github.io/wikidata_bib).


## Instalation

Currently, WikiBib is mostly tested on Linux (Ubuntu). 
If you use Windows you can install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL; [tutorial here](https://allthings.how/how-to-use-linux-terminal-in-windows-10/0)) and then proceed with the installation normally. The process for installing WSL should take less than 30 minutes in our experience. 

See [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) for instructions on how to install it, and [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) for instructions on how to use it. 

# Requirements

So far, Wikidata Bib has only been tested in Debian based systems. 
For the instructions, you will need to have installed:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

* A recent version of [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Python3.8+)

It is also recommended (but not strictly necessary) to havn:

* [GitHub Command Line Interface](https://cli.github.com/)
